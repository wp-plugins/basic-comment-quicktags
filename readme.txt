Displays bold, italic, add link and quote buttons on top of the comment form.

== Description ==

This plugin displays the most basic of quicktag buttons on your comment forms, using the Quicktag API built into WordPress (as of 3.3).

You can turn these on and off for bbPress or comments on the discussions page (see the screenshots). Please note, the plugin defaults to <em>off</em>, so you have to go turn them on. Auto-activating isn't nice, as it may conflict with other plugins.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you do this? =

MarcTV did it because he needed a simple plugin to do this job and decided to do it on his own. I kind of love him for that. 

I forked it so I could extend it to bbPress, put in more checks and ifs/thens, and all the other toolbars were too heavy.

= Why only those tags? =

After careful consideration, and a long review of my users, those are the only ones they ever use! If you have a reasonable argument why I should add in others, I'll listen. Thus far, the only suggestion interesting was 'code' and I determined people won't use that unless they know about it, and thus are capable to entering it manually.

= Will you add in options to pick and chose our tags? =

No. I don't have a need for it, and I don't want to include code I'm not going to personally make use of. It makes it much harder on me to support it later. (Read <a href="http://www.sohar.com/proj_pub/download/COMPAS93.pdf">Herbert Hecht's article "Rare Conditions – An Important Cause of Failures"</a> to understand my views on including rarely used code. tl;dr: I try not to.)

= Can I use this on older versions of WordPress? =

No. This plugin uses the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Quicktags_API">Quicktags API</a> built in to WordPress 3.3. I only support the current version of WP and one back, so keep that in mind.

= Does this work on Multisite? =

Yes. It can be network activated or per-site, works fine.

= What version of bbPress does this work on? =

It's been tested up to 2.5.1 as of December 7, 2013.

= This isn't showing up on bbPress! =

If you're using the bbPress Fancy Editor, it won't work. Really, the fancy editor is 'more' than this, so you shouldn't be using both.

= Will you expand this to BuddyPress? =

Not at this time.

= My users say they don't see anything on IE8 =

IE8 cheerfully ignores the rules of jQuery. 

Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I got it to work, and then came back an hour later to no changes and it broke. At which point I bashed my head into the wall and went to the gym. Between caching and IE8 being inconsistant, I gave up. If anyone can fix it for everyone better than Trepmal did, you officially win. This is as good as I can get it. It works like a hero on Firefox, Safari, Chrome and IE9+, so I strongly suggest for consistant Internet behavior, upgrade IE.
